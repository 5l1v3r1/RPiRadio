# RPiRadio
Raspberry Pi Radio

## Goal
I'm going to make my Raspberry Pi Radio project, completely commented and explained to allow anyone to understand how it works.

## Inspiration
My insipration come from other similar project:
- http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter
- https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/PiFmDma
- https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds
- https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx

They are very good projects, but they are so bad coded and so bad documented that everything looks like a doodle.

I want to try to document everything and make this amazing use of the Raspberry's GPIO as easy and clean as possible.
